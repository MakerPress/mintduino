Sub-Task 3 will add to the same circuit you assembled for Sub-Tasks 1 and 2 by introducing the single pushbutton component to the mini breadboard, as seen in <<Figure7>>.

Add the pushbutton to the mini breadboard by inserting it so that the distance between the two top legs is a single hole (on a single row) and the distance between a top and a bottom leg has two holes between it (spanning four rows altogether).  A closeup of this can be seen in <<Figure8>>.

<<Figure9>> shows the pushbutton inserted into the mini breadboard.  Make certain to leave the left-most hole open on the top and bottom row where the pushbutton is inserted.  (These will be used to add jumper wires.)
