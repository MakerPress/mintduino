*Title*: MintDuino

*Yellow Bar Text*: Simple Electronics Projects

*The MintDuino is a fun and easy device for you to build, but putting it together is really only the beginning.  From there, your imagination is the only limitation when it comes to providing the MintDuino with other capabilities.  Beginners are often overwhelmed and uncertain where to start when it comes to turning an idea into reality.  And that's where MintDuino Notebook 1 will help - by demonstrating how a basic MintDuino game between two players can be "built up" by starting small and adding features, bit by bit.
With just a few extra LEDs and pushbuttons and some jumper wires, MintDuino Notebook 1 will show you how to transform your MintDuino into a simple game.  You'll start by wiring up a single LED and then learning to control it with a pushbutton.  Later you'll learn how to add more LEDs and how to use an extra pushbutton to create the final challenge for the Notebook - building the MintDuino Reflex Game.
